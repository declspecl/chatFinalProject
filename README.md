# chatFinalProject

A multithreaded client-server chat application made for my Introduction to Networking class.
Users join rooms and chat with other users in the same room.
Messages sent by a user will be fanned out and sent to all other users in the same room by the server.
No practical limit to the number of rooms or users that can be chatting at once.
